I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) most extensively for various tasks including statistical analyses, data preprocessing and visualisation.
I use Matlab for analysing electroencephalogram data mainly with [fieldtrip toolbox](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) and for building experiments.
I use [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) for acoustic analyses.
I recently began to use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for conducting a word2vec analysis.
