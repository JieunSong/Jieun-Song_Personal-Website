I had great opportunities to take part in reseach projects on Korean intonation when I was a masters student at SNU. I am still continuing research in this area by working on a project on prosodic disambiguation of wh-words in Korean. This is collaborative work with [Dr. Jieun Kiaer](https://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/people/jieun-kiaer) at the University of Oxford and [Dr. Haesung Jeon](https://sites.google.com/site/haesungjeon/) at the University of Central Lancashire. In Korean, sentences with wh-words can be ambiguous between wh-questions and yes-no questions as a wh-word (e.g., 뭐) can be used either as a wh-pronoun (“what”) or an indefinite pronoun (“something”). Previous work has shown that prosody, especially accentual phrasing plays a role in diambiguating such sentences (Jun & Oh, 1996; Yun, 2012). However, yes-no questions often occur with certain experiential or attitudinal/softening adverbs (e.g., hanbun “once, sometime”, chom “please”). In this project, we are looking at how prosodic cues interact with these semantic cues when disambiguating wh sentences.
