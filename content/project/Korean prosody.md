I have been working on this project in collaboration with Prof. Jieun Kiaer at University of Oxford. In Korean, sentences with wh-words can be ambiguous between wh-questions and yes-no questions as a wh-word (e.g., 뭐) can be used either as a wh-pronoun (“what”) or an indefinite pronoun (“something”). Previous work has shown that prosody, especially accentual phrasing plays a role in diambiguating such sentences (Jun & Oh, 1996; Yun, 2012). However, yes-no questions often occur with certain experiential or attitudinal/softening adverbs (e.g., hanbun “once, sometime”, chom “please”). In this project, we are looking at how prosodic cues interact with these semantic cues when disambiguating wh sentences. For more information, please see my recent presentation at BAAP 2018.
