Project page will be updated soon.I worked with [Prof. Ho-Young Lee](https://hoyounglee.me/) at Seoul National University on a project evaluating English rhythm proficiency with measures of sentence stress. In a paper published in *Applied Psycholinguistics* in 2019, we showed that sentence stress scores of Korean learners of English were highly correlated with their overall speaking proficiency. This was part of a larger project with computer engineers where we built an automatic sentence stress feedback system for Korean learners of English, and this system was found to improve their pronunciation (published in *Computer Speech and Language*, 2017).
