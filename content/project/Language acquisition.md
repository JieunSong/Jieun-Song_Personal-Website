I am also interested in various issues in speech development and multilingualism. I am currently working on a project on the acquisition of sibilant fricatives by Korean-English bilingual children with [Kathleen McCarthy](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/people/academic/profiles/mccarthy.html) at the Queen Mary University of London. I am also an author of [this book](**) and was involved with a collaborative work with researchers in Korea on how children disambiguate wh-words in Korean using prosody (see [here]()).
