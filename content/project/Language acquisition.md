I have been actively involved in other projects on child language development. I have written a book on child language acquisition with [Dr. Jieun Kiaer](https://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/people/jieun-kiaer) at the University of Oxford, which was published in 2019 by a highly prestigious publishing house of South Korea, Science Books. While writing this monograph, I became more interested in broader issues on language development and multilingualism. I am collaborating with researchers at Seoul National University and Dr. Jieun Kiaer on a project investigating how Korean children disambiguate wh-words in Korean using prosody. This work is currently under review in *Journal of Child Language*.
