abstract = "In Korean language, utterances containing ambiguous WH-WORDS may be interpreted as either wh-questions or yes-no questions. This study investigated forty-three Korean three-year-olds’ ability to disambiguate eight WH-PHRASES using prosodic and visual cues. The intonation of each phrase provided a cue as to whether it should be interpreted as a wh-question or a yes-no question. The phrases were presented alongside picture stimuli, which acted as either a matched (presentation of corresponding auditory-visual stimuli) or a mismatched contextual cue (presentation conflicting auditory-visual stimuli). Like adults, children preferred to comprehend wh-phrases as wh-questions rather than yes-no questions. In addition, children were as effective as adults in disambiguating wh-phrases using prosodic cues regardless of the visual cue. However, when confronted with conflicting auditory-visual stimuli (mismatched), the quality of children’s responses was less accurate than adults’ responses."
