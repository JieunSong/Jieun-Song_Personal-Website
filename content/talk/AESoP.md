abstract = "Previous research has suggested that cortical entrainment to slow amplitude fluctuations in the speech signal (i.e., amplitude envelope) plays an important role in speech perception. However, it remains unclear how cortical entrainment to the speech envelope relates to higher-level linguistic processes. The present study investigated how cortical entrainment to continuous speech differs depending on whether or not the listener understands the linguistic content of the speech signal. EEG was thus recorded from listeners with different linguistic backgrounds (i.e., native English and Korean speakers) while they heard continuous speech in three languages (i.e., English, Korean, and Spanish) in passive and active listening tasks. Furthermore, some studies have suggested links between the brainstem response to speech and higher-level speech processing or cognitive functions (e.g., attention), and recent methods can allow for measurement of the brainstem response to single-trial continuous speech. The current study thus examined the frequency following response (FFR) to continuous speech in the same experiment in an attempt to explore relationships between the FFR and higher-level speech processing. The results suggest that cortical tracking of the envelope is mainly modulated by acoustic properties of the speech signal rather than listenersâ€™ higher-level linguistic processing. The results of the FFR analysis will also be discussed in relation to the cortical entrainment results."
