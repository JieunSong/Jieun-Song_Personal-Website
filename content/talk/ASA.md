abstract = "Brain oscillations in the auditory cortex become entrained to slow amplitude fluctuations in the speech signal (i.e., amplitude envelope) during speech comprehension. Previous research has suggested that this cortical activity plays an important role in speech perception by aligning neuronal excitability to parts of the incoming speech signal that contain linguistic information such as syllables. However, it remains unclear how cortical entrainment to the speech envelope relates to higher-level linguistic processes during speech comprehension. The aim of the present study was to see if cortical entrainment to the amplitude envelope varies depending on whether or not the listener understands the linguistic content of the speech signal. To this end, the phase-locking between neural oscillations and amplitude envelopes of speech were measured in EEG recordings from listeners with different linguistic backgrounds (i.e., native English and Korean speakers) while they heard continuous speech in three languages (i.e., English, Korean, and Spanish). The results demonstrate that auditory-cortical tracking of the envelope is not affected by whether or not listeners understand the speech, supporting the view that envelope-tracking activity is mainly independent of higher linguistic processes."
