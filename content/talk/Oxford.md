abstract = "In this talk, we will discuss our research on the disambiguation of wh-words in Korean based on data from a questionnaire and a speech production experiment. Sentences with wh-words (e.g., 무엇, 언제) can be ambiguous in Korean between wh-questions and yes-no questions because wh-words can be used as a wh-interrogative or an indefinite pronoun (e.g., what did you eat? vs. Did you eat anything?). Previous research has mainly focused on the role of prosody in the disambiguation of these sentences. However, the results of our questionnaire have found that users of Korean rely on semantic cues (e.g., adverbs of quantity) to distinguish the two types of questions during reading. Furthermore, speech production data have shown that prosodic disambiguation is also affected by the type of adverbs used in the sentence which indicates one reading over the other. This suggests that speakers of Korean rely on multiple cues available to successfully disambiguate wh-words. We will also discuss these results in terms of communication strategies used to avoid ambiguity."
