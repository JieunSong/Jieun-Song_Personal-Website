      <description>Listening to a second language (L2) in real life situations (e.g., a noisy restaurant) can be challenging. Native listeners can flexibly modulate their speech processing to overcome the demands of a noisy environment e.g., use semantic-contextual information to understand what is being said. We know very little, however, about the strategies second-language listeners use to enhance their listening. Using electroencephalography (EEG), my PhD work published in Cognition demonstrated that greater listening effort exerted by L2 listeners enhances their auditory processing, as measured by neural tracking of speech, even though their linguistic processes (e.</description>

      <description>I worked with Prof. Ho-Young Lee at Seoul National University on a project evaluating English rhythm proficiency with measures of sentence stress. In a paper published in Applied Psycholinguistics in 2019, we showed that sentence stress scores of Korean learners of English were highly correlated with their overall speaking proficiency. This was part of a larger project with computer engineers where we built an automatic sentence stress feedback system for Korean learners of English, and this system was found to improve their pronunciation (published in Computer Speech and Language, 2017).</description>

      <description>I have been actively involved in other projects on child language development. I have written a book on child language acquisition with Dr. Jieun Kiaer at the University of Oxford, which was published in 2019 by a highly prestigious publishing house of South Korea, Science Books. While writing this monograph, I became more interested in broader issues on language development and multilingualism. I am collaborating with researchers at Seoul National University and Dr.</description>

      <description>I had great opportunities to take part in reseach projects on Korean intonation when I was a masters student at SNU. I am still continuing research in this area by working on a project on prosodic disambiguation of wh-words in Korean. This is collaborative work with Dr. Jieun Kiaer at the University of Oxford and Dr. Haesung Jeon at the University of Central Lancashire. In Korean, sentences with wh-words can</description>
