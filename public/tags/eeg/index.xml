      <description>Listening to a second language (L2) in real life situations (e.g., a noisy restaurant) can be challenging. Native listeners can flexibly modulate their speech processing to overcome the demands of a noisy environment e.g., use semantic-contextual information to understand what is being said. We know very little, however, about the strategies second-language listeners use to enhance their listening. Using electroencephalography (EEG), my PhD work published in Cognition demonstrated that greater listening effort exerted by L2 listeners enhances their auditory processing, as measured by neural tracking of speech, even though their linguistic processes (e.</description>
