      <description>By examining neural responses to speech using Electroencephalography (EEG), my research has investigated how listeners process speech across different stages of speech recognition, especially in adverse conditions (e.g., listening in a noisy environment, listening to second-language speech). People often report they have to “listen harder” in these difficult conditions, but it is not clear how this effort changes the processes involved in recognising speech.
My research has demonstrated that greater listening effort exerted by non-native listeners as well as native listeners enhances their auditory processing, as measured by neural tracking of speech (see Song &amp;amp; Iverson, 2018; Song et al.</description>
