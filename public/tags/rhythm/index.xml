      <description>I worked with Prof. Ho-Young Lee at Seoul National University on a project evaluating English rhythm proficiency with measures of sentence stress. In a paper published in Applied Psycholinguistics in 2019, we showed that sentence stress scores of Korean learners of English were highly correlated with their overall speaking proficiency. This was part of a larger project with computer engineers where we built an automatic sentence stress feedback system for Korean learners of English, and this system was found to improve their pronunciation (published in Computer Speech and Language, 2017).</description>
