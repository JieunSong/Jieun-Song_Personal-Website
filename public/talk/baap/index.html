  <meta name="description" content="In Korean, sentences with wh-words can be ambiguous between wh-questions and yes-no questions as a wh-word (e.g., /mwə/) can be used either as a wh-pronoun (“what”) or an indefinite pronoun (“something”; e.g., “what are you going to talk about?” vs. “Are you going to talk about anything?”).

The aim of the present study was to investigate how prosodic disambiguation of wh-phrases in production is modulated by lexical and semantic cues in the sentence (i.e., experiential and attitudinal modals). Native speakers of Korean were recorded reading sentences which had different types of adverbs before the ambiguous wh-phrase. No other information was given regarding which type of reading was appropriate. The results of the prosodic analysis showed that the target wh-phrase was produced with two Accentual Phrases and a High boundary tone (H%; i.e., yes-no question reading) more frequently when it was preceded by an experiential or attitudinal/softening adverb (e.g., hanbun “once, sometime”, chom “please”), while the whquestion reading was more common overall (i.e., default reading). In addition, the prosodic characteristics of yes-no questions were found more often with certain types of phrases – those that are more likely to occur in suggestions (e.g., “go for lunch”). Our findings suggest that prosodic disambiguation of wh-phrases in Korean is sensitive to lexical and semantic information available in the sentence.">
